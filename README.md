cruisecountdown
===============

A count down clock for cruising that I've been using on an old iPhone 3G I had laying around.  Great for count down events, and has triggerable sounds / rotating background images. I pick at it here and there adding features :) You can also use another device, just upload the files to your website / webserver, point your device (iphone, etc) to it and bingo.  If you choose to use an old iPhone / iPod you may have laying around (optimal), make sure you create a homescreen bookmark where you've uploaded the files.  This will make a pretty slick, seamless experience..
